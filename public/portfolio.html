      <h1>Building an AI Powered Portfolio from Scratch</h1>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>“So I built an A.I.-powered portfolio…” I've been saying that a lot lately. The truth is, I have no idea if it'll actually work the way I want it to. With the tech industry shifting rapidly and A.I. reshaping everything from workflows to entire job roles, A.I. has quickly become less “future” and more “now”—I knew I had to dive in.</p>
    
      <p>A.I. is no longer just a buzzword floating around Silicon Valley—it's in everyday conversations. Even my dad, who's more likely to be at home under the hood of a car than behind a screen, started referencing ChatGPT. That's when I realized: instead of diving into a brand-new project in healthcare or finance—industries I've always found fascinating—maybe the smartest thing to do was redesign something much closer to home: my portfolio which admittedly had been quietly collecting dust.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>The Drive</h2>
      <p>Portfolios are like sandcastles—meticulously crafted, beautiful for a moment, and then slowly washed away by time and trends. Most designers never feel like they're <em>done</em>. Give it a year or two, and we're already dreaming of starting from scratch.</p>
    
      <p>As I looked at the portfolios that inspired me (and probably inspired hundreds of others), I noticed a pattern. Sure, the content and style change, but the <em>experience</em>? Pretty identical.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Image: [Photo of designer looking more professional than they really are]</p>
        <p>H1: “Hey, I am [insert designer name here]”</p>
        <p>H2: “I'm a [Job Title] with a passion for design, research, and writing user acceptance criteria…”</p>
        <p>New Section: This is my work.</p>
    
      </blockquote>
    
      
      <p>Multiply that by 200+ portfolios, and yeah—it's a blur.</p>
    
      <p>Thinking about my portfolio I started to think about what its purpose is and what I want it to say about me. My job as a Product Designer is to create intuitive AND innovative experiences. I still needed to highlight my work, but maybe I could rethink the vessel that delivers it.</p>
    
      <p>I wanted users landing on <em>brianprouty.com</em> to say “wait whaaaaat?!”. My goal was to break away from the cookie-cutter template while still making it easy to explore my projects. I decided to put the AI front and center—trained on my work and ready to answer questions. It's a risk, I know. Attention is short, and unfamiliar interfaces don't always help. But I also believe that if the experience is clear, intuitive, and just different enough, it might just spark curiosity—and that's all I need to get someone to take the next step.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>The Mapping</h2>
    
      <p>I split my audience into four types of visitors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recruiters</li>
        <li>Hiring Managers / Project Managers</li>
        <li>Design Leaders / Directors</li>
        <li>My friends (aka troublemakers)</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>To better understand how each group might interact with my site, I mapped out a user journey for each:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recruiters</strong>: Discover → Skim → Skim more → Reach out</li>
        <li><strong>Hiring Managers</strong>: Nudge from recruiter → Dive in → Explore process → Debate with team → Setup interview</li>
        <li><strong>Design Leaders</strong>: Casual glance → Deeper look at skills → Chat with the team → Next steps</li>
        <li><strong>Friends</strong>: Get curious → Ask absurd questions → Portfolio refuses to humor them</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>With the user journeys in place, a solid design system carried over from my previous site, and a clear vision, I set out to create something new.</p>
    
      <p>Initially, I defaulted to what I always do: fire up Figma and start designing a prototype. But this time, I found myself wondering what kind of <em>application</em> I wanted to build—something more interactive, more dynamic. That curiosity led me down the rabbit hole of OpenAI's APIs. The more I explored, the more I started to believe I could actually pull this off.</p>
    
      <p>I've dabbled in front-end development for a few years, but I still consider myself a novice. I've leaned heavily on Stack Overflow to get through past projects, but everything I'd been hearing about AI tools suggested they could help me get unstuck faster. So I decided to give it a go.</p>
    
      <p>And like any aspiring developer in 2025, I turned to ChatGPT...</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>The Development</h2>
    
      <p>It all started with one prompt:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>“Assume the role of an experienced web developer well-versed in implementing OpenAI APIs for the rest of this conversation.”</em>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>From there, ChatGPT walked me through everything. I explained my idea:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>“I am a product designer and a beginner developer that needs help creating a new AI driven website page. The idea behind this is you would be able to arrive on the page and ask questions about the 'Brian' and get responses. This would only reference information about Brian such as professional experience, hobbies, skills, values, things Brian has worked on in the past and nothing else. An example question a user would ask: 'What is Brian's professional experience'. Can you walk me through, in great detail, how I would do this?”</em>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>And it did. In detail. I mean, I'm not saying it handed me a finished app, but as someone who still considers himself a novice, I got about 70% of the way there with barely a hiccup.</p>
    
      <p>But then my luck, or more accurately, my skill ran out.</p>
    
      <p>I was having an issue where the API couldn't find the JSON file. I was in too deep in chatGPT land, buried in folders I'd created via terminal commands I barely understood. I could not figure out why, no matter where I moved the data, the program couldn't find it. After a week of frustration, I was ready to scrap the whole thing.</p>
    
      <p><strong><em>Taco Tuesday saved my side-quest project.</em></strong></p>
    
      <p>Over tacos, I told my friend Sam—an actual computer science grad and far more legit developer—about my issue. He asked, “Have you tried using Cursor?”</p>
    
      <p>I blinked. “What's Cursor?”</p>
    
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cursor is an AI code editor that understands your entire codebase and helps you debug and build in real time. Within minutes, it solved the JSON issue. Then it helped me add things like streaming, animated text, and mobile responsiveness. It was like having a senior dev sitting over my shoulder—minus the judgment.</p>
    
      <p>And just like that, the project was back on track.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>The Feedback Stage</h2>
    
      <p>Once the build was far enough along, I knew I needed to get some outside eyes on it before throwing it into the ether. So I started cold-messaging recruiters and design leaders to get some honest feedback.</p>
    
      <p>Huge shoutout to those who took the time—especially considering how weird it probably felt to get a cold message from someone asking, “Hey, wanna try my AI-powered portfolio?”</p>
    
      <p>Some of the responses were positive, but a lot pointed to areas where I needed to step it up. The biggest issues:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>The layout didn't play nice with smaller laptop screens</li>
        <li>Users weren't sure what to do when they landed on the page</li>
        <li>There was no obvious link to a traditional portfolio</li>
        <li>The AI responses felt too long and too scripted</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>A few quotes that stuck with me:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><em>“I can't see everything I need to on my smaller laptop.”</em> — Caitlin, Senior Recruiter</li>
        <li><em>“You have very little time to get recruiters to look at a portfolio, not to mention interact with it.”</em> — Erika, Recruiter</li>
        <li><em>“You shouldn't force your users into this—if they're expecting a portfolio, they should be able to find your work quickly.”</em> — Kyle, Director of Design</li>
        <li><em>“The responses from this are waaaay too long and sound too robotic.”</em> — Sam, Friend and Senior Engineer</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>Tough love—but 100% necessary.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Iteration</h2>
    
      <p>After gathering all that feedback, I rolled up my sleeves and made some updates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added more breakpoints so it works better across screen sizes (even those tiny laptops)</li>
        <li>Improved the prompt suggestions so they're clearer and more personal</li>
        <li>Threw in a call-to-action in the nav so people can find the traditional portfolio faster</li>
        <li>Rewrote the AI's tone to sound less like a robot and more like… well, me—your favorite friendly product designer.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>The end result? A portfolio powered by AI that can answer questions about <em>me</em>, using only the info I fed it.</p>
    
      <p>Give it a spin—I'd love to hear what you think (or what you ask it)!</p>
