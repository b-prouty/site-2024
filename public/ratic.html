          <p>Real Advantage Title Insurance Company (RATIC) is a child company to Orange Coast Title. The web
            application they had before me was old not only needed a design refresh but also needed the added
            functionality of being able to work with companies from outside the "family of companies".</p>
          <p>The goal of this project was to identify any usability issues with the initial release as well as add
            the ability to handle outside users to create and find Cover Protection Letters (CPLs).

      Background
    </h2>
    <p>Before, working with internal clients was very straight-forward but now that the company was working
      towards opening up the service to the third party clients, we needed to consider all the different processes
      that potential customers already implement in their everyday workflow. </p>
  
    <p>We needed to do this in a way where the user-experience did not feel confusing or over-crowded or else we
      would jeopardize the possibility of the user getting frustrated and going back to something they were
      already familiar with. Another problem we faced was a way for Administrators to oversee new "Entities" being
      added from both internal companies and new third-party companies.</p>
  
    <p> Users of the system had very little complaints with the overall functionality of the sight but did
      complain about some usability issues, such as not being able to find previously made CPLs, that we decided
      to address.

    <h2>
      Pain points and new functionality
    </h2>
    <p>I conducted research interviews with some of our primary users to uncover any pain points they experienced
      with the active version.</p>
  
    <p><b>Top pain points identified:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not being able to find previously made CPLs</li>
      <li>Not being able to read the forms fields that were required </li>
      <li>There was too many steps to get to creating a CPL (96% of users were only there to create)</li>
      <li>User's had to enter the same information over and over again (i.e. name, company, company address, etc)
      </li>
      <li>It was very hard to create these reports in a mobile view as the website was not responsive.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>After discussion with stakeholders, the acceptance criteria for the new version of the site would need to
      cover.</p>
  
    <p><b>New functionality would include:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to add new outside entities to the system.</li>
      <li>Each entity would contain an array Issuing Agent Offices, and each Issuing Agent Office contains the
        users associated with that office</li>
      <li>Tiered user ranking where each user would be either a User, Admin, or Super Admin.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Users</b> have no control over assigning offices, what office they or others are associated wit.
        </li>
        <li><b>Admin</b> are able to Manage all of the Issuing Agent Offices and their users <em>within</em> their
          entity.</li>
        <li><b>Super Admin</b> are able to control all Entities, Issuing Agent Offices, and Users. Super admin was
          limited mainly to the Development team and stakeholders of the company.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Reference Libraries containing title insurance information, rate estimate calculators, and a way to
        manage the content of their account, and if they are an admin member, the site.</li>
